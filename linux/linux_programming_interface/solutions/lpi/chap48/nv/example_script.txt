// Example script for `nv`, a name-value service. This script exercises
// every functionality implemented by the `nv` command. See the README.md
// file for more information.
//
// This script can be run using:
// 	$ ./nv example_script.txt

set os linux      // set the `os` key to "linux"
setifnone prog nv // if the `prog` key is not set, assign the value "nv" to it

get os           // gets the value associated with the `os` key
assign osName $_ // assigns the value above, if any, to a variable called `osName`

get prog           // gets the value associated with the `prog` key
assign progName $_ // assigns the value above, if any, to a variable called `progName`

assign msg The value of // assigns a variable called `msg` to the "The value of" string

print $msg os is $osName     // prints "The value of os is ${content of variable `osName`}
print $msg name is $progName // prints "The value of name is ${content of variable `progName`}

delete os // deletes any value associated with the key `os`
get os    // gets the value associated with the key `os` (in this case, there will not be any)
assign osName $_ // assigns the value in the `os` key to the `osName` variable.

print os is now $osName // prints "os is now ${content of variable `osName`}
print Goodbye.          // prints "Goodbye."
